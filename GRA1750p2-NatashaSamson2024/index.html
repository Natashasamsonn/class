			<p>The Best Healthy Tuna Salad!	
             Anyone else love a good tuna salad? It is one of my favorite recipes to make for a quick, easy, and satisfying lunch. Tuna is packed with protein and when you add a little mayonnaise to the mix you also include a great source of healthy fats.
             This healthy tuna salad is made with fresh veggies,and spice to add incredible flavor and take your tuna salad to the next level.</p>

			<h3>Steps</h3>
			<ol>
			<li>Drain the cans or pouches of tuna. I like to press the lid of the can against the tuna to ensure that all of the water has been removed. Then transfer it into a bowl and use a fork to separate the pieces.</li>
			<li>Chop up your celery and cucumbers to small pieces.</li>
			<li>Next, add a small cap size of lemon juice to the tune. Then add the mayonnaise, celery, cumcumber, and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>	
			<li>Stir everything until well combined and give the tuna salad a taste. Adjust the levels of salt and pepper to fit your tastebuds and then either serve immediately or place the tuna salad in an air-tight container in the fridge.</li>
